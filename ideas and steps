I'm trying to create a machinelearning algrithm based on this dataset to predict which department you may want to go base on
how many times you wanna spent on working/month.

My steps
1:collect data(completed)
2:prepare data(delete all valueless data like value =o or null)(completed)
3:analyze data
4:plot data
5:test algrithm(k-means)
6:use algrithm
